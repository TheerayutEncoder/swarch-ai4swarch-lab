# Bonus (optional, take-home): Recover an unwritten decision (approximately 15 min)

> **Lecture link:** T5 (Dhar et al. generate decisions from code and diagrams to reduce *knowledge vaporization*), AICH4.
> **Question:** when AI explains *why* a system was built this way, how much of the explanation is evidence and how much is a confident guess?

## Run

Start a new chat or session in your agent and send:

```
Follow prompts/bonus-recover-decision.md
decision: Why do all services communicate synchronously over gRPC, using one shared demo.proto?
evidence: system/online-boutique/protos/demo.proto, system/online-boutique/src/checkoutservice/main.go, system/online-boutique/src/frontend/main.go
```

The agent writes the reconstructed ADR, including its **Claim check** table, to [`outputs/bonus-recovered-adr.md`](outputs/bonus-recovered-adr.md).

## Audit the claim check

Choose **five** claims from the agent's table: at least two it marked *Evidenced* and two it marked *Inferred*. Check each one yourself.

| # | Claim (short) | AI says | You say | Why (file path or reasoning) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

**Count:** of all the agent's claims, how many are *Evidenced* according to the agent? ___ According to you? ___

## Reflect

1. Did the agent ever label a guess as *Evidenced*? Give an example, or explain how you checked that it didn't.
2. A new developer reads only this reconstructed ADR. What wrong belief could they form?
3. What can AI recover from code, and what can only the original architects know? Use one example from your ADR.
